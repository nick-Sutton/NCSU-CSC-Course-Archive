# CSC 216: Software Development Fundamentals | CSC 217: Software Development Fundamentals Labüñ•Ô∏è
The second course in computing, intended for majors and minors. Emphasis is on exploring encapsulation; polymorphism; composition; inheritance; finite state machines; linear data structures (including array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, and the tradeoffs in implementation); and recursion (including recursive linked lists) in the context of the software development lifecycle including the processes and practices for designing, implementing, and testing high quality software.

Laboratory course to accompany CSC 216 lecture course. Application of the software processes and practices to design, implement, and test the development of software solutions requiring composition; inheritance; finite state machines; and linear data structures, including recursive linked lists.
