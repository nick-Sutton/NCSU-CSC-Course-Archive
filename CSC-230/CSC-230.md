# CSC 230: 	C and Software Tools
In this course, students will develop skills in several important areas. First, we'll get some experience working in C, a language that lets us think like procedural rather than object-oriented developers. Also, being a fairly low-level language, C lets us see and control more of what's going on in the hardware. This can help us think about using the hardware more effectively, whether we're actually programming in C or in a higher-level language. While we learn C, we'll also learn about tools and techniques that help us build, manage, debug and analyze software projects.
